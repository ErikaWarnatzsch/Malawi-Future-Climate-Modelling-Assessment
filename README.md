# Malawi-Future-Climate-Modelling-Assessment

Python scripts to determine the projected climate change in Malawi using the output of various CORDEX RCMs for temperature (mean, max and min) and precipitation.

These scripts were created as part of a NERC funded PhD project.

Erika Warnatzsch was funded by a NERC doctoral training partnership grant (NE/L002558/1).
